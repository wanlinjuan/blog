## Research Experience
### Missing data imputation based on sampling methods in single-cell analysis       
*	Based on downsampling and sampling methods to impute dropout events in single-cell data.
*	Compare the clustering performance with existing methods like Scimpute and RESCUE.
### Pseudo-value approach for informative cluster size                            
*	Code from scratch for Kaplan-Meier estimates and competing risk estimates, and also pseudo-values.
*	Perform simulation based on GEE using pseudo-value approach for informative cluster size to see performance.
### Knockoff in case-cohort study based on group LASSO      
*	Code from scratch for group LASSO and knockoffs. Perform simulation to calculate power and false discovery rate.
*	Improve performance based on derandomized knockoffs to control false discovery rate.
### Use of external information to improve statistical estimation for infant mortality data 
*	Preprocess infant mortality data and seek relationship between factors and outcomes based on regression analysis.
*	Perform Monte-Carlo simulation study to compare two types of estimation methods using additional information.
### Improving outcomes of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Analysis of the SEER database                      
*	To see if survival rate improves over time, estimate survival rate using Kaplan-Meier estimation.
*	Perform regression analysis on survival data based on Cox proportional hazards model. 
*	For secondary malignancy data, perform Poisson regression model to estimate rate ratio.
### Patients’ perspective on post-operative success following bariatric surgery
*	Using quality of life data, explore whether time or type of bariatric surgery influences Physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) in SF-36 questionnaire.
*	Find whether there is relationship between PCS, MCS versus Patient Health Questionaire-9(PHQ-9) score and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale(RSE).
### Self-Reported Coping Strategies in Postlingually Deafened Adults and Speech Recognition Outcomes                          
*	In a retrospective cohort study, characterize the degree to which individual coping strategies may influence speech perception following cochlear implantation.
*	Perform Correlation analysis among quality-of-life measures, speech outcome measures and scores of coping strategies.
